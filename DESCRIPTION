Description: Provides a user-friendly interface to map on-targets and off-targets
    of CRISPR gRNA spacer sequences using bowtie. The alignment is fast, 
    and can be performed using either commonly-used or custom CRISPR nucleases.
    The alignment can work with any reference or custom genomes.
    Both DNA- and RNA-targeting nucleases are supported.
